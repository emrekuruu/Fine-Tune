# Poetry Starter Guide

1. Install Poetry: pip install poetry

2. Create your virtual environment: poetry install ( for notebooks please select this virtual env. )

3. Activate it to run scripts: poetry shell

4. Add dependancies of your own: poetry add "library-name" ( what you would normally write in pip install "library-name" goes here )
